(help me)

## TurtleSequencer.py
This is a horrifying way to actively draw with python turtle

It uses sequences of instruction in the format of x,y/x,y/x,y

This is a horribly tedious way to draw(but I'm proud of this)

You can find examples of drawings in drawings/presets.txt

## TScreator.py
This using pygame to create a way to more easily draw using TurtleSequencer

I'm not giving any instructions for this, right now(me lazy)

## linestitcher
Does what the name suggests, it stitches multiple lines into one line

put what you want stitched into linsti-in.txt, the output will be put in linsti-out.txt

the SEP variable at the top of the file is what is put between each line attached
